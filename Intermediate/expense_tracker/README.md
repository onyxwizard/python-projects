# ðŸ“Š Expense Tracker Project

## Overview

This repository contains a fully functional **Expense Tracker** application. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly tool that helps individuals or organizations track their expenses efficiently. ðŸš€ The project is developed in the `Intermediate_Python` folder and includes features such as expense logging, category-wise analysis, summary reports, and visualizations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Intermediate_Python**: This folder serves as the workspace for the Expense Tracker project. It contains all the source code, data files, and documentation related to the project.
  - `main.py`: Main entry point for the application.
  - `input_handler.py`: Handles user input and validation.
  - `storage.py`: Manages persistent storage of expenses in `data/expenses.csv`.
  - `reports.py`: Generates monthly and category-wise expense reports.
  - `visualization.py`: Provides visualizations of spending trends.
  - `category_list.py`: Defines predefined categories and subcategories.
  - `data/expenses.csv`: Stores all user-added expenses persistently.

## Features

### 1. **Expense Logging**
Users can log their expenses by providing:
- **Description**: A brief description of the expense (e.g., "Grocery Shopping").
- **Amount**: The monetary value of the expense (e.g., `50.00`).
- **Category**: Select from predefined categories (e.g., "Food > Groceries").
- **Date**: The date of the expense in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### 2. **Category-wise Analysis**
Expenses are grouped into predefined categories and subcategories, such as:
- **Food**: Groceries, Dining Out, Snacks
- **Housing**: Rent/Mortgage, Utilities, Maintenance
- **Transportation**: Public Transport, Private Vehicle, Ride Sharing

### 3. **Summary Reports**
Generate detailed reports:
- **Monthly Report**: Displays total expenses grouped by month and category.
- **Category-wise Breakdown**: Shows total spending for each category.

### 4. **Data Persistence**
All expenses are stored persistently in `data/expenses.csv`. The program ensures that no data is lost between sessions.

### 5. **Visualizations**
Visualize your spending habits with:
- **Monthly Spending Trends**: A bar chart showing total expenses for each month.
- **Category-wise Spending**: A bar chart displaying total spending by category.

## Example Test Case

### Input Example:
1. Add the following expenses:
   - Description: "Grocery Shopping", Amount: `50.00`, Category: "Food > Groceries", Date: `2023-10-01`
   - Description: "Electricity Bill", Amount: `100.00`, Category: "Housing > Utilities", Date: `2023-10-02`
   - Description: "Movie Tickets", Amount: `20.00`, Category: "Entertainment > Movies & Events", Date: `2023-10-03`

### Output Example:
1. **Monthly Report**:
```
   === Monthly Expense Report === 

   Month: 2023-10
     Food > Groceries: 50.00Housing>Utilities:100.00
     Entertainment > Movies & Events: 20.00Totalfor2023âˆ’10:170.00 
```

2. **Visualization**:
