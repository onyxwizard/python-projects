## 🌟 Example Usage

### Input:
```
======================================
Welcome to the Math Tables! 

Enter the Integer value of the table -> 5
[OPTIONAL] Enter the range of the table greater than 10.
If not enter '0' -> 0 
```

### Output:
```
5 x 0 = 0
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
